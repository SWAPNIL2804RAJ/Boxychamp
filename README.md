#Boxchampy #UI/UX #FIGMA

Stay fit, learn to box! Boxing is not only a great workout but also a fun and engaging way to stay in shape. Whether you're a seasoned pro or a beginner, boxing can help you build strength, agility, and endurance. Plus, it's a fantastic stress-reliever!But before you jump in the ring, it's important to train yourself and keep yourself ultimately fit if you want to maintain good health and wellness. So, keeping in mind fitness I have designed a poster for a training centre named as "BOXCHAMPY". 

As, I started learning UI/UX designing recently, this is my first poster designed using Figma. 
In this i took a frame of width 1440 and height 1668.
Then I divdided the frame into 3 parts, the first part contain heading, then the body part, and then at the end footer.
Then I added images to poster by importing them into Figma. I resize and crop it and adjust the capacity of images to fit my poster design.
While Writting the heading I use the background and added a image over it and also used linear grading
and the main features of the centre is added using a rectangle and masking it.And under that I added the Drop shadow effect of red color with blur of 200. 
Also I downloaded some of teh icons using website iconfinder.com and imported in figma.
At last I designed the footer and made it a perfect poster.

Here, is my First project on Figma.
