Stay fit, learn to box! Boxing is not only a great workout but also a fun and engaging way to stay in shape. Whether you're a seasoned pro or a beginner, boxing can help you build strength, agility, and endurance. Plus, it's a fantastic stress-reliever!But before you jump in the ring, it's important to train yourself and keep yourself ultimately fit if you want to maintain good health and wellness. So, keeping in mind fitness I have designed a poster for a training center named as "BOXCHAMPY". 
As, I started learning UI/UX designing recently, this is my first poster designed using Figma. 
Remember! Fitness and boxing go hand-in-hand, so start your journey today and take your fitness to the next level!
